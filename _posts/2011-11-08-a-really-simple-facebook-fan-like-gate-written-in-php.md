What is it?
-----------

It's a Facebook tab app where you have to like the page before you're allowed to see the hidden content. You know, like the classic <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cocacola">Coca-Cola</a> one*.

1. Decodes the signed request that contains the like status.
2. Renders a view depending on the like status.
